== Favorite Waypoint Widget ==

The idea behind the Favorite Waypoint widget is to allow a person to easily and quickly tag a spot to remember later. The widget will be represented as a five-pointed star. Tapping the star will grab the current location information and save it.


== Track Recording Widget ==

The Track Recording widget will start and stop the periodic recording of location information. Once started, a track will continue being recorded until stopped. The period of recording is configurable in the application's main preferences screen.
